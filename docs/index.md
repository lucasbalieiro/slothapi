# ðŸ¦¥ SlothAPI

Welcome to SlothAPI, a project to study and understand the inner workings of web frameworks by creating a WSGI-compliant web framework from scratch. This project is for educational purposes and is not intended for production use.

## Why SlothAPI?

"Don't reinvent the wheel" is a common saying in software development, but to truly understand how the wheel works, sometimes you need to build it yourself. This project aims to deepen the understanding of web frameworks and the Python Web Server Gateway Interface [WSGI](https://peps.python.org/pep-3333).
