# ðŸ¦¥ SlothAPI - My Python Web Framework Study Project

This project is a study of PEP 3333 and an attempt to create my own WSGI-compliant web framework to understand how things work under the hood. IT IS NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE.

## Overview

**Why do this thing?!**

I know that reinventing the wheel is something that I should avoid in the enterprise environment. But, in this case I want to know how this wheel works, so i can understand better the tools that i use

## Goals

- Understand the Python Web Server Gateway Interface v1.0.1 - [PEP 3333](https://peps.python.org/pep-3333/#preface-for-readers-of-pep-333)
- Learn the internal workings of web frameworks
- Experiment with different design patterns and architectures
- Improve my Python programming skills
